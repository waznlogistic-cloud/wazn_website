# Supabase Setup Guide

Complete guide for setting up Supabase backend for Wazn platform.

---

## 📋 Step 1: Create Supabase Account & Project

1. **Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)**
2. **Sign up** (GitHub, Google, or Email)
3. **Create New Project:**
   - Name: `wazn-platform`
   - Database Password: Create a strong password (save it!)
   - Region: Choose closest to your users (Middle East recommended)
   - Plan: Free (perfect for development)
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for project creation

---

## 📋 Step 2: Get API Credentials

1. In Supabase Dashboard → **Settings** (gear icon) → **API**
2. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

---

## 📋 Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create `.env` file in project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**Important:** `.env` is already in `.gitignore` to keep credentials safe.

---

## 📋 Step 4: Create Database Tables

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **"New query"**
3. Open `database/schema.sql` from this project
4. Copy entire contents
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"** (or Ctrl+Enter)

### Verify Tables Created:
- Go to **Table Editor**
- You should see: `profiles`, `providers`, `provider_drivers`, `orders`, `transactions`, `proof_of_delivery`, `permits`, `notifications`

---

## 📋 Step 5: Configure Authentication

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. **Enable Phone Authentication** (for phone confirmation):
   - Scroll to "Phone Auth"
   - Enable Phone provider
   - Turn ON "Enable phone confirmations"
   - Users will receive SMS code to verify their phone number

3. **Configure Email Auth:**
   - Email provider should be enabled by default (for login)
   - Turn OFF "Enable email confirmations" (since using phone confirmation)

**Note:** Account confirmation will be done through phone numbers (SMS), not email.

---

## 📋 Step 6: Test the Connection

1. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check browser console:**
   - Should see no errors
   - If you see "Missing Supabase environment variables", check `.env` file

3. **Test registration:**
   - Go to `/select-user`
   - Register a test user
   - Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
   - Check Table Editor → profiles table

---

## 📋 Step 7: Set Up Storage (Optional - For File Uploads)

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Create buckets:
   - `proof-of-delivery` - For delivery proof images
   - `permits` - For provider permits/licenses
   - `profiles` - For profile pictures

3. Set up policies (in SQL Editor):
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow users to read their own files
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own files"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```
